# What is the CORS? #
In simple terms it means **requests a resource from a different domain, protocol, or port than the one from which the current document originated.**

# When the CORS will be triggered? #
When u use [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) or [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) to requests the cross-origin resource: 
*	A method other than GET or POST is used, or if POST is used with a Content-Type other than one of application/x-www-form-urlencoded, multipart/form-data, or text/plain.
*	A custom header (such as X-PINGARUNER) is sent with the request.

**it will be triggerd.**

# Functional overview or how to implements the CORS functional about browser#
First the browser will preflight an options request,soliciting supported methods from server,and then, upon "approval" from the server, sending the actual request with the actual HTTP request method.

# Simple requests #
a so-called “simple request”—is one that meets all the following conditions:
-	The only allowed methods are:
	-	GET
	-	HEAD
	-	POST
-	Apart from the headers set automatically by the user agent, which are:
	-	Accept
	-	Accept-Language
	-	Content
	-	Content-Type(but note the additional requirements below)
	-	Downlink
	-	Save-Data
	-	Width
	-	DPR
	-	Viewport-Width
-	The only allowed values for the Content-Type header are:
	-	text/plain
	-	application/x-www-form-urlencoded
	-	multipart/form-data
-	No event listeners are registered on any XMLHttpRequestUpload object used in the request; these are accessed using the XMLHttpRequest.upload property.
-	No ReadableStream object is used in the request.
